# how-to-debug

1. drink water
2. take a break- move around enough to get physically tired
3. look for overflow
4. look for overflow again, very carefully, or just make everything a long
5. add print statements, find _where_ the problem is
6. add MORE print statements
7. RTFM
8. STFW
9. ask someone for help (incl. online)
10. compare your code with other people's code that does a similar thing
11. write down the issue
12. if it's a complicated issue, make a tree/graph of all that needs to be done to resolve it, with its dependencies
13. eat something
14. rubber duck debug
15. code on paper
16. work on something else
17. step back- is this work necessary? do we already have a good-enough solution? does this thing actually serve the desired purpose already?
18. test random test cases
19. test more random test cases
20. go to sleep
21. go for a walk
22. look at the library source code that's going wrong
23. put print statements in the above
